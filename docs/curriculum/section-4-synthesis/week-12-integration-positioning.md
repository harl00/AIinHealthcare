## Content

### 12.1 Developing Your Professional Position

**Integrating Multiple Perspectives**

Bringing together:
- Technical understanding (how AI works)
- Safety analysis (what can go wrong)
- Ethical reasoning (what should we do)
- Practical wisdom (what works in reality)

**Navigating Between Extremes**

Avoiding:
- Uncritical AI enthusiasm (techno-utopianism)
- Reflexive AI rejection (techno-phobia)
- Passive acceptance (AI will happen to us)
- Analysis paralysis (we can never know enough)

Finding:
- Informed scepticism
- Constructive engagement
- Active shaping of AI adoption
- Comfort with uncertainty

**Communicating About AI**

Audiences and approaches:
- Patients: transparency, reassurance, choice
- Colleagues: evidence, practical implications
- Executives: value proposition, risks, governance
- Regulators: compliance, safety, evidence
- Public: balanced perspective, demystification

**Advocating for Responsible AI**

In your professional context:
- Raising concerns appropriately
- Supporting good governance
- Contributing to evaluation and monitoring
- Sharing learning and experience

### 12.2 Contested Questions in Healthcare AI

**Autonomy and Automation**

Where should the line be?
- What decisions should AI never make alone?
- When is human oversight genuinely necessary?
- How do we balance efficiency with safety?
- What does meaningful human control look like?

**Equity and Access**

Will AI reduce or increase disparities?
- Who benefits from healthcare AI?
- Who bears the risks?
- How do we ensure equitable access?
- Can AI address existing inequities?

**Professional Identity**

What is the role of the clinician?
- How does AI change what it means to be a doctor/nurse/paramedic?
- What core professional values must be preserved?
- How do we maintain professional satisfaction?
- What should future practitioners be trained for?

**Governance and Accountability**

Who decides how AI is used?
- What is the appropriate role of clinicians in AI governance?
- How should patients be involved?
- What accountability mechanisms are needed?
- How do we balance innovation with precaution?

### 12.3 Strategies for Ongoing Learning

**Following the AI Field**

Without being overwhelmed:
- Key journals and publications
- Newsletters and digests
- Professional networks
- Conferences and events

Filtering signal from noise:
- Identifying credible sources
- Recognising hype
- Focusing on applicable developments

**Critical Appraisal Skills**

For AI claims:
- What evidence is presented?
- Who funded/conducted the research?
- What are the limitations?
- Does it apply to my context?

**Professional Networks**

Communities of practice:
- Clinical informatics groups
- Professional college AI committees
- Cross-disciplinary networks
- International connections

**Contributing to Evidence**

Active participation:
- Participating in AI evaluations
- Reporting implementation experiences
- Sharing lessons learned
- Advocating for research needs

### 12.4 Course Synthesis

**Review of Key Concepts**

The learning arc revisited:
- Foundations: How AI works
- Evaluation: Whether we should use it
- Application: How to implement safely
- Synthesis: Where we go from here

**Integration Across Learning Outcomes**

Connecting the threads:
- Technical understanding enables critical evaluation
- Critical evaluation informs implementation
- Implementation experience shapes future positioning
- Future positioning requires ongoing technical learning

**The Practitioner Question Journey**

From "What is this?" to "What comes next?"
- You now have frameworks for each question
- Questions recur as new AI emerges
- The cycle continues throughout your career

### 12.5 Aeromedical Strategic Positioning

**What Should Australian Aeromedical Services Do?**

Strategic questions:
- Where should we lead vs. follow?
- What capabilities do we need to build?
- How do we engage with AI development?
- What governance is appropriate?

**Developing a Service Position**

Framework for strategic AI positioning:
- Current capability assessment
- Horizon scanning for relevant AI
- Opportunity and risk evaluation
- Capability building roadmap
- Governance framework
- Stakeholder engagement
