## Task Description

Develop a comprehensive analysis of an AI technology for healthcare application. This capstone project integrates learning across all four unit outcomes, demonstrating your ability to synthesise technical, evaluative, implementation, and future-oriented perspectives.

Choose **one of two streams**:

---

## Stream A: Implementation Strategy

Develop a detailed implementation strategy for introducing a specific AI technology into an Australian aeromedical or healthcare setting.

### Requirements

Your strategy must address all five components:

#### 1. Technical Overview (approximately 600 words) — LO1

Provide a technical overview of the AI system:
- Architecture and algorithms
- Data requirements and sources
- System capabilities and limitations
- Technical integration requirements

#### 2. Risk and Ethical Analysis (approximately 800 words) — LO2

Present comprehensive risk and ethical analysis:
- Safety risks and failure modes
- Bias and equity considerations
- Ethical implications
- Regulatory requirements
- Mitigations for identified risks

#### 3. Implementation Approach (approximately 1,200 words) — LO3

Detail the implementation approach:
- Governance structure and oversight
- Validation strategy (local validation, silent running, etc.)
- Workflow integration design
- Training and competency requirements
- Change management approach
- Monitoring and maintenance plan
- Contingency and incident response

#### 4. Future Analysis (approximately 600 words) — LO4

Analyse how the technology may evolve:
- Expected technological developments
- Implications for the implementation
- Adaptation and update strategy
- Long-term sustainability

#### 5. Position Statement (approximately 800 words)

Conclude with a justified position:
- Should this implementation proceed? Why/why not?
- What conditions must be met?
- What would success look like?
- What would change your recommendation?

---

## Stream B: Critical Analysis

Produce a critical analysis of an emerging AI technology and its implications for Australian healthcare.

### Requirements

Your analysis must address all five components:

#### 1. Technology Explanation (approximately 600 words) — LO1

Explain the technology and its current development state:
- Technical foundations and architecture
- Current capabilities and limitations
- Development trajectory
- Healthcare applications (current and potential)

#### 2. Critical Evaluation (approximately 800 words) — LO2

Critically evaluate implications:
- Safety risks and concerns
- Ethical implications
- Regulatory challenges
- Equity and access considerations
- Evidence base and gaps

#### 3. Implementation Analysis (approximately 800 words) — LO3

Analyse implementation requirements:
- What would implementation require?
- What barriers exist?
- What governance would be needed?
- What workforce implications arise?

#### 4. Future Trajectory (approximately 800 words) — LO4

Predict development and implications:
- How will this technology evolve?
- What healthcare applications will emerge?
- What disruptions might occur?
- What should Australian healthcare do to prepare?

#### 5. Position Statement (approximately 1,000 words)

Present a defended position:
- How should Australian healthcare respond to this technology?
- What actions should be taken now?
- What should be monitored?
- What is your professional position on this technology?
