## Task Description

Critically evaluate a healthcare AI tool for potential deployment in an Australian aeromedical or critical care context. Produce a recommendation report structured for a clinical governance committee audience.

This assessment builds on your Technical Foundations Analysis (Assessment 1), adding critical evaluation of safety, ethics, and regulatory considerations.

---

## Requirements

Your report must address the following five components:

### 1. System Description (approximately 400 words)

Describe the AI system and its intended use case:
- What does the system do?
- How would it be used in the clinical workflow?
- Who would use it and when?
- What decisions or actions would it inform?

*Draw on your LO1 knowledge but focus on application context.*

### 2. Safety Risk Analysis (approximately 600 words)

Analyse the safety risks of deploying this system:
- What failure modes could occur?
- What is the potential severity of failures?
- How might algorithmic bias affect patients?
- What human-AI interaction risks exist (automation bias, alert fatigue, etc.)?
- How might performance degrade over time?
- What additional risks arise in aeromedical/critical care contexts?

*Consider both technical and sociotechnical failure modes.*

### 3. Ethical Analysis (approximately 500 words)

Evaluate the ethical implications of deployment:
- How does deployment align with bioethical principles (autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice)?
- What transparency and explainability considerations apply?
- What consent requirements should apply?
- What equity implications exist?
- Are there professional ethical considerations?

*Apply ethical frameworks, not just list concerns.*

### 4. Regulatory and Legal Assessment (approximately 400 words)

Assess compliance with Australian regulatory requirements:
- What TGA classification would apply?
- What evidence requirements must be met?
- What post-market obligations exist?
- What professional/legal considerations apply to users?
- What organisational obligations arise?

### 5. Recommendation (approximately 600 words)

Provide a justified recommendation to the governance committee:
- Should deployment proceed? (Yes/No/Conditional)
- If conditional, what conditions must be met?
- What mitigations are required?
- What governance and monitoring should be established?
- What would change your recommendation?

*Your recommendation should follow logically from your analysis.*

## Scenario Options

Select one of the following scenarios, or propose an alternative for approval:

### Option A: Deterioration Prediction in Retrieval

A vendor proposes an AI system that monitors patient vital signs during aeromedical transport and predicts deterioration risk. The system would alert crew to increased risk and suggest interventions.

### Option B: Dispatch Triage AI

A dispatch AI system that analyses incoming case information and recommends resource allocation (air vs. road, team composition, priority level) for retrieval coordination.

### Option C: Point-of-Care Ultrasound AI

An AI-assisted ultrasound interpretation system for use by retrieval teams, providing automated detection of key findings (e.g., pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, abdominal free fluid).

### Option D: Clinical Documentation AI

An AI system that generates clinical documentation from audio recordings of patient encounters and crew handovers during retrieval missions.

*Proposal for alternative scenario due Week 5.*

## Marking Criteria

| Criterion | Weighting | Description |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Safety Analysis | 25% | Depth and accuracy of safety risk identification and analysis |
| Ethical Reasoning | 20% | Sophistication of ethical framework application |
| Regulatory Accuracy | 15% | Accuracy of regulatory and legal assessment |
| Recommendation Quality | 25% | Logic, justification, and practicality of recommendation |
| Communication | 15% | Appropriate tone, structure, and clarity for governance audience |

### Grade Descriptors

**High Distinction (85-100%)**
Demonstrates comprehensive safety analysis with sophisticated risk identification across technical and sociotechnical dimensions. Ethical analysis applies frameworks with nuance and depth. Regulatory assessment is accurate and complete. Recommendation is well-justified, practical, and follows logically from analysis. Communication is professional and appropriate for governance audience.

**Distinction (75-84%)**
Demonstrates thorough safety analysis with good risk identification. Ethical analysis applies relevant frameworks effectively. Regulatory assessment is largely accurate. Recommendation is justified and practical. Communication is professional and clear.

**Credit (65-74%)**
Demonstrates adequate safety analysis with main risks identified. Ethical analysis addresses key considerations. Regulatory assessment is mostly accurate. Recommendation is reasonable though justification could be stronger. Communication is appropriate.

**Pass (50-64%)**
Demonstrates basic safety analysis with some risks identified. Ethical analysis is superficial. Regulatory assessment has gaps. Recommendation lacks full justification. Communication needs improvement.
