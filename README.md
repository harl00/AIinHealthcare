## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Explain the foundations of AI Architecture** – Analyse the core components, algorithms, and models used in healthcare AI applications.
2. **Critically evaluate AI Safety** – Assess the challenges, risks, and ethical implications of AI in clinical settings.
3. **Implement and monitor AI in Healthcare** – Apply best practices for integrating AI solutions safely and effectively.
4. **Analyse Current and Emerging AI Technologies** – Investigate existing AI applications and predict future advancements in healthcare.

## Pedagogical Framework

**Learning Arc:** Foundations → Evaluation → Application → Synthesis

**Practitioner Question Progression:**
- Weeks 1-3: *"What is this?"*
- Weeks 4-6: *"Should we use it?"*
- Weeks 7-9: *"How do we govern it?"*
- Weeks 10-12: *"What comes next?"*
