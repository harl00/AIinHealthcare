# AI in Healthcare: Unit Overview

## Unit Description

This unit examines the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in contemporary multidisciplinary healthcare, with a focus on AI architecture, safe implementation, ethical considerations, and emerging innovations. Students will critically evaluate AI technologies in healthcare settings, assess their advantages and risks, and explore future trends in AI-driven multidisciplinary healthcare.

## Context

The unit is designed for health practitioners in the Australian context, with particular emphasis on aeromedical retrieval. This focus provides a lens through which to examine AI applications in high-stakes, time-critical, and resource-constrained environments.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

1. **Explain the foundations of AI Architecture** – Analyse the core components, algorithms, and models used in healthcare AI applications.
2. **Critically evaluate AI Safety** – Assess the challenges, risks, and ethical implications of AI in clinical settings.
3. **Implement and monitor AI in Healthcare** – Apply best practices for integrating AI solutions safely and effectively.
4. **Analyse Current and Emerging AI Technologies** – Investigate existing AI applications and predict future advancements in healthcare.

## Pedagogical Framework

### Learning Arc

The unit follows a scaffolded progression:

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | Cognitive Level |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **Foundations** | 1-3 | Core concepts, architecture, terminology | Knowledge & Comprehension |
| **Evaluation** | 4-6 | Critical assessment, risk analysis, ethics | Analysis & Evaluation |
| **Application** | 7-9 | Implementation, integration, monitoring | Application & Synthesis |
| **Synthesis** | 10-12 | Future directions, position-taking | Synthesis & Creation |

### Practitioner Question Progression

Each phase addresses a core question that practitioners face when encountering AI:

- **Weeks 1-3:** *"What is this?"* – Technical literacy
- **Weeks 4-6:** *"Should we use it?"* – Critical evaluation
- **Weeks 7-9:** *"How do we govern it?"* – Implementation & oversight
- **Weeks 10-12:** *"What comes next?"* – Future readiness

### Why Evaluation Before Application?

In safety-critical domains like healthcare and aeromedical retrieval, practitioners must understand risks, limitations, and ethical implications *before* implementing AI systems. This sequencing reflects the precautionary approach appropriate to clinical contexts.

## Aeromedical Context Integration
